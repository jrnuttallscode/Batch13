// Create a class "Location" Immutable by following the steps:
//
//    1. Don't provide setters.
//
//    2. Make all fields final and private
//
//    3. Don't allow the class to be sub-classed.
//
//    4. If the instance fields include references to mutable objects, don't allow those objects to be changed:   
//
//            -  Don't provide methods that modify the mutable objects.
//
//            -  Don't share references to the mutable objects.
//
// NOTE: Not all classes documented as "immutable" follow these rules. However, the steps above 
// are the basis of an Immutable Class.
